# Basic Math Functions
Using javascript, write the functions listed below. These should be in a separate javascript file. Your html file needs to have two inputs where the user can put in two numbers, then four buttons to execute each of the math functions. When a function is called, it should display the result in some easy to see way. A simple alert is enough, though feel free to make something more elaborate.

Styling is optional. You can keep it as simple as this, or make it awesome. Here is the description of the javascript functions to make:

1. Write a function add(x, y) that adds two numbers.

2. Write a function multiply(x, y) that multiplies two numbers.

3. Write a function square(x) that squares a number (note: it must use multiply).

4. Write a function addSquares(x, y) that adds the squares of two numbers (note: it must use both add and square).

## Submission

Create a repository with your html file as well as your javascript file and submit the link to the repo.
